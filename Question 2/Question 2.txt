Homework 3 Part 1 Question 2

For this question I will explain the algorithm for computing a new serial number based on any input name. I also included a python file in the Question 2 folder which can be run to give the same results.
The algorithm consists of 3 steps:
1) Compute the sum of all characters of the username. ASCII characters all have a corresponding int value.
	1.1) XOR the total with 0x5678
2) XOR the serial number with 0x1234
3) Pop up the success dialog box if both results match.

If I gave my name 'Alexander' the corresponding serial number is '18136'
For the TA's names we get:
Name = 'Shifu', Serial = 17715
Name = 'Yiming', Serial = 17793
Name = 'Yujie', Serial = 17866
